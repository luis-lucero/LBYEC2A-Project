            <p class="letter">
                I know I am in love because I see you every way I turn--no matter what I am doing. I know I want to be with you, not just with you, but share everything with you, too. Just being close to you is not enough for me. I want to be a part of you; A part of your life forever. I never have to wonder if you love me. You complete me--my heart and my soul.
            </p>
            <p class="letter">
                You're my best friend, my lover, and my soul mate. You have been there and supported me like no one else has before. I'm lost without you. I love you more than life itself. There are no words I can say to truly tell you how much I really love you. I couldn't picture myself without you in my life. You are perfect for me in every possible way, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
            </p>
            <p class="letter">
                You give me reason to strive for more of everything. I learn more and more from you every day. My heart is forever yours. I know saying, "I love you" is powerful, yet I feel it's not enough. My life was a wreck before now. I never thought it would change, but you came into my life and everything took a turn for the best. You show me the value of life. You give me the most amazing feelings inside. It feels great to actually love and be loved in return. We have been friends for over three years now, and I know we have only been dating for a short time now, but I know our love will last a lifetime. I can't wait until I am your wife. I love you with all my heart. I am yours forever.
            </p>
