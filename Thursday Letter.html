            <!--Letter Proper-->

            <p class="letter">
                Ever since you came into my life with this heavenly made gift called "love," I have noticed so many changes in my lonely world. You made me believe again that love comes to those who know and listen to the music of love.
            </p>

            <p class="letter">
                You have touched my life in so many ways, like being here for me at a time when I thought all hope was lost. When I was deserted and thought that the world had come to an end, you stood by me through all the rough and difficult times. You made me understand that life is all about appreciation and understanding, but must be appreciated first before there can be understanding, and neither can exist without having experienced love first.
            </p>

            <p class="letter">
                I want to make this promise to you, based on the love that you have shown me, and the things you have done to teach me again what hope means. I declare my love for you alone, no one but you, and that is from the bottom of my heart. I promise to be there for you, both in good and in bad times, because you are worth everything to me.
            </p>
